# Security model and multi-tenancy

Longarm runs commands on other machines by design. This document describes
who may do what, how several people can share one hub and its workers
without seeing each other's work ("multi-tenancy level 2"), what is
isolated, what is not, and where the limits are. For reporting
vulnerabilities see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Levels

| Level | Who shares the fleet | Isolation between people | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | one person (or people who fully trust each other) | none | the default: `[isolation] mode = "shared"`, every workload runs as the worker's service account |
| **2** | **semi-trusted users** (colleagues, a team, students) | **API ownership + one OS account per user on every worker** | users on the hub, `[isolation] mode = "per-user"` on Windows and Linux workers |
| 3 | untrusted users | per-job VMs / containers, network namespaces | not implemented (see [outlook](#level-3-outlook)) |

## Threat model (level 2)

**Actors.** Several people ("users") share one `longarm-hub` and its
workers. Each user has one or more devices; every device has its own client
certificate from the hub's CA, which names the user. **Admins** (admin
certificates, panel administrators) are trusted: they manage users, workers
and releases and may act on everything. The hub operator and the machines'
local administrators are trusted. Workers are trusted to enforce the rules
for the users they serve.

**Assets of a user A.** A's jobs and sessions (existence, command lines,
environment, state, exit codes, output logs, terminals), A's files, code
(mirrors, worktrees, uploads), secrets passed to A's jobs, A's dev servers
(ports), A's hub data (job index entries, events, devices, quota usage).

**Adversary.** User B - curious, not necessarily malicious, but able to use
every Longarm API with B's own certificate and to run arbitrary code as B on
every worker B can reach (that is what Longarm is for). B must not be able
to **read, modify, observe or interfere with** A's assets:

- through the Longarm APIs (worker gRPC, hub gRPC, hub web panel and its
  JSON/SSE API, MCP tools, `longarm daemon`'s local API, the built-in sshd);
- from inside B's own jobs, sessions and shells on a worker A also uses.

**Out of scope:** kernel, hypervisor and driver escapes; hardware and
timing side channels; denial of service beyond what quotas cover (disk
filling, network saturation, fork bombs inside B's own cgroup / Job Object);
compromised admins, hubs or workers; level 3 (untrusted code).

## Identities

- Every certificate carries an identity URI `longarm://<role>/<name>` and,
  for devices of a user, `?user=<user>` (`longarm://client/alice-laptop?user=alice`).
  The **user** (the owner of everything a device creates) is the `user`
  parameter, or - certificates without one, e.g. from before
  multi-tenancy - the certificate's name.
- `longarm admin user add alice` creates the user on the hub and prints a
  join code **bound to the user**: the device that enrols with it gets a
  certificate of user `alice` (device name `alice`, or `alice-2`, ... or
  `--device`). More devices: `longarm admin user code alice`.
- Teams are hub-side groups (`longarm admin team add t1 alice bob`). A job
  submitted with `longarm run --share team` (or `--share team:t1`) may be
  **read** (state, logs) by the members of the owner's team(s); only the
  owner and admins can kill it. Sessions are never shared.
- `longarm admin user disable alice` refuses the user's calls on the hub
  and - with the next policy push, within seconds - on every worker.
  `longarm admin user remove alice` revokes the certificates of all of
  alice's devices; with `--purge` every worker also kills alice's jobs and
  sessions and deletes alice's data and OS account.

## When users are separated

The **hub** separates users as soon as one user exists (`longarm admin user
add`), a worker with per-user isolation has connected, or `[tenancy]
enabled = true` is set in `hub.toml`. Until then everybody sees everything,
as in a one-person fleet (so a person with a laptop and a desktop as two
plain client certificates keeps seeing both machines' jobs).

The hub pushes a **tenancy policy** to every worker (users, teams, quotas,
disabled and purged users; persisted in `<data>/tenancy.json`). A worker
enforces ownership on its API when the policy says users are separated
**or** it runs with `[isolation] mode = "per-user"`.

## What is enforced

### Longarm APIs (hub and workers, default deny)

| Item | Owner | Team member (shared job) | Other user | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| jobs: get, list, logs, wait | yes | read-only | not found | yes |
| jobs: kill | yes | no | not found | yes |
| job ids | | | taken ids are refused (`AlreadyExists`, no details) | |
| sessions: list, attach, kill, logs | yes | no | not found / denied | yes (`--owner`) |
| files, workspace sync, exec, sshd/sftp | as the user's OS account (per-user) | - | - | as the admin's own account |
| port forwards (per-user) | to loopback ports the user's own processes listen on | - | refused | any |
| worker metrics | aggregate (no process lists) | - | - | with process lists |
| hub job index, events, `longarm jobs`, MCP tools | own + team-shared | | hidden | everything |
| hub node list | workers without process lists and others' mirrors; own devices | | others' devices hidden | everything |
| audit log, users, teams, join codes, links, releases, profiles | no | | no | yes |
| web panel | "My jobs", nodes (read-only), "Me" for user logins | | | everything ("People" page for users, teams, quotas) |

Every worker audit record carries the acting certificate and, for devices
of a user, the user (`"user": "alice"`); the hub's records name the caller
(`web/<login>`, `admin/<name>`). A request the hub relays to a worker (panel
kill / logs / submit) is checked on the hub and audited on the worker as
`<who> via hub`; hub-submitted jobs run as the requesting user.

### Quotas

Per user (`longarm admin user add|set ... --max-jobs ...`) with a default in
`hub.toml` `[tenancy.default_quota]`:

| Quota | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| `max_jobs`, `max_mem_gb` (fleet-wide active jobs / reserved memory) | the hub's scheduler (`longarm run` placement, panel and `longarm admin run`): the request waits in the queue (or fails with `--no-queue`) |
| `max_jobs_per_worker`, `max_mem_gb_per_worker`, `max_sessions_per_worker` | every worker, on submit / session start |
| `job_mem_gb`, `max_job_mem_gb`, `job_cpus`, `max_job_cpus` (per-job defaults and caps) | every worker: Job Object memory / CPU-rate limits on Windows, cgroup `memory.max` / `cpu.max` on Linux (per-user isolation) |

### Per-user OS isolation on workers

`[isolation] mode = "per-user"` in `longarmd.toml` (MSI `ISOLATION=per-user`,
deb `LONGARM_ISOLATION=per-user` / `longarmd-peruser.service`, `longarmd
service install --isolation per-user`). longarmd runs as **LocalSystem**
(Windows) or **root** (Linux) and maps every Longarm user to a local account
`la-<user>` (prefix: `[isolation] account_prefix`; names that don't fit are
shortened with a hash), created on first use.

| | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| account | local user, random 40+ character password nobody knows; only "Log on as a batch job"; denied interactive, remote desktop, network and service logon | `useradd`: locked password, own group, private home (0700), no supplementary groups |
| how workloads start | S4U logon (`LsaLogonUser`, no password; needs SeTcbPrivilege) → primary token → `CreateProcessAsUser`, suspended until assigned to the job's Job Object; a window station of its own logon session; only its standard handles inherited | `setuid`/`setgid`, supplementary groups dropped, its own cgroup v2 (`/sys/fs/cgroup/longarm/<account>/<job>`, started inside it with `CLONE_INTO_CGROUP`), umask 077 |
| profile / home | `C:\Users\la-<user>`; longarmd keeps the profile loaded while it runs (HKCU for all the user's processes) | `/home/la-<user>` |
| who runs what as the user | jobs, sessions (ConPTY / pty), `exec`, the built-in sshd's shells, commands and **sftp**, and a short-lived **user helper** (`longarmd user-helper`) that does every Files and Workspace call, job preparation (git fetch, worktrees) and worktree pruning | same |
| what stays privileged | longarmd and the per-job **shims** (they start the workload as the user and write `status.json` / `out.log`; job directories are not writable by the user, so a user cannot make a privileged shim do anything else) | same |

**Data layout** (default `<data>/users`; `[isolation] users_dir`):

```
<data>/                     SYSTEM + Administrators / root only; users may only traverse it
  tls/ audit.log tenancy.json ...
  users/                    traverse only (no listing)
    la-alice/               SYSTEM + Administrators (+ traverse for la-alice) / root:la-alice 0710
      owner                 "alice"
      jobs/ sessions/       job and session dirs: privileged, private
      mirrors/ worktrees/   owned by la-alice, private (owner + SYSTEM + Administrators / 0700)
      staging/ tmp/
```

Mirrors are **per user**: alice's objects never land in a mirror bob's jobs
read. The scheduler's cache affinity is per user too (workers report
`<user>/<repo>`; other users don't see the repository names).

**Secrets** (`--secret-env`) are kept in the shim's memory (a privileged
process) and the job's environment (the user's processes). Other accounts
cannot read either (Windows: no `PROCESS_VM_READ` on other users' processes;
Linux: `/proc/<pid>/environ` needs ptrace access). On disk they exist
nowhere; logs are redacted.

**Port forwards** (`longarm forward`, `fleet_forward`, ssh `-L`): only to
loopback ports on which a process of the caller's own account listens
(Windows: `GetExtendedTcpTable` → owning process → its token's user;
Linux: `/proc/net/tcp{,6}` → socket uid). A port with a listener of another
account is refused, too.

**The built-in sshd** (`longarm ssh-config`, `longarm proxy`): shells, `exec`
and sftp run as the caller's account; direct listeners with
`authorized_keys` are ignored in per-user mode (they have no Longarm
identity).

**Toolchain** (hub profiles) is installed machine-wide in per-user mode
(winget `--scope machine`, npm global packages next to `node.exe` on
Windows, `uv` in `/usr/local/bin` on Linux) so every account has git, node,
pnpm, uv, pwsh, claude and copilot; per-user agent settings (`~/.claude`,
`~/.copilot`) stay in each account's profile.

**macOS** workers refuse `mode = "per-user"` with a clear error (launchd +
setuid per user is not implemented); they stay usable in shared mode, with
API ownership only.

## What is not isolated (known gaps)

Level 2 keeps users apart through the OS's user separation, not through
containers. These remain:

- **Loopback networking between users on one worker.** B's process can
  connect to A's dev server on `127.0.0.1:3000` directly (only Longarm's own
  forwards check the port's owner). Bind dev servers with authentication or
  use level 3 (network namespaces).
- **Process lists.** On Linux every account sees every process and its
  command line in `/proc` unless `/proc` is mounted with
  `hidepid=invisible` - longarmd warns at start. Do it:
  `mount -o remount,hidepid=invisible /proc` and in `/etc/fstab`
  (`proc /proc proc defaults,hidepid=invisible 0 0`). On Windows other
  users' process **names** are visible (not their command lines or
  memory).
- **World-accessible OS objects** the workloads create themselves: files in
  shared places (`/tmp` - the umask of 077 makes new files private,
  `C:\Users\Public`, `C:\ProgramData`), named pipes and shared memory with
  permissive default ACLs, abstract unix sockets. Workloads should keep
  their data in their home, worktree or `TMPDIR`.
- **Shared isolation mode.** Without `mode = "per-user"` (and on macOS)
  every workload runs as the same service account: the API hides other
  users' jobs, sessions and process lists, but any job can read the service
  account's files - including other users' worktrees and logs - and port
  forwards reach any address the worker can reach. Use it only for people
  who trust each other.
- **Fleet-wide quotas** are enforced by the hub's scheduler. A client that
  submits to a worker directly (`longarm run --on w1`) is bound only by the
  per-worker quotas there.
- **Disk space** is not limited per user (GC still collects old jobs and
  mirrors); neither is network bandwidth.
- **Admins** see and do everything (including attaching to others'
  sessions); worker administrators can read everything on their machine; the
  hub can submit jobs as any user to workers with `[hub] remote_jobs =
  "all"`.
- **Disabling a user** refuses new calls at once and closes the user's open
  connections on the hub and - when the policy arrives, within seconds - on
  every worker; jobs that are already running keep running (kill them, or
  remove the user with `--purge`).
- **Windows profiles** stay loaded until reboot if longarmd itself is killed
  (not stopped); a later purge then removes the account but leaves
  `C:\Users\la-<user>` until the next reboot.
- **Side channels** (CPU caches, timing, `/proc/meminfo`-style aggregates,
  the hub's node metrics) are out of scope.

## Operations

- **Turning it on for an existing fleet**: add the users on the hub
  (`longarm admin user add ...`; existing client certificates keep working
  and act as the user of their name), then switch workers one by one to
  per-user isolation: stop longarmd, reinstall the service as LocalSystem /
  root with `--isolation per-user` (or set `[isolation] mode = "per-user"`
  and change the service account), start it. Jobs from shared mode stay
  visible to admins (legacy space) until GC removes them.
- **Data dir on Linux**: every parent of the users dir must be traversable
  by the accounts (`o+x`): `/var/lib/longarmd` (root's default data dir and
  the deb's per-user unit's) is; `~root/.longarm` is not - `longarmd service
  install --isolation per-user` refuses it (with `--data-dir`) and longarmd
  refuses to start on it, both naming the blocking directory. Without
  `--data-dir`, the install uses `/var/lib/longarmd` and copies an
  enrollment an older longarmd left in `~root/.longarm` (keys stay 0600,
  dirs 0700; remove the old copy afterwards). On Windows the per-user
  default is `C:\ProgramData\Longarm\longarmd`, created with a protected
  DACL (SYSTEM and Administrators) - ProgramData's inherited ACL would let
  every local user read the node key. See docs/usage.md "Data directory".
- **cgroups** (Linux): longarmd creates `/sys/fs/cgroup/longarm`; with
  systemd you may prefer `Delegate=yes` and `[isolation] cgroup_root`
  inside the unit's cgroup. Without cgroup v2, jobs run in process groups
  (no memory/CPU limits, escaped processes survive a kill) and longarmd
  warns.
- **Removing a user**: `longarm admin user remove alice --purge`. Workers
  that are offline purge when they reconnect (the purge list is part of the
  policy). `longarmd leave --purge` and uninstalling a per-user worker
  delete all `la-*` accounts it created.

## Level 3 outlook

Untrusted users need more than accounts: a job per container or micro-VM
(Windows: Hyper-V isolated containers / sandboxes; Linux: user + network +
mount + PID namespaces, gVisor or Firecracker), per-job network policy
(loopback and LAN isolation, egress rules), per-user disk quotas, and an
image-based toolchain. Longarm's job model (shim per job, user helper,
per-user data spaces, hub-side policy) is the place to plug that in: the
shim would start the workload in a sandbox instead of a Job Object /
cgroup, and the user helper would run inside the user's sandbox.
